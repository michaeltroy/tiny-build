# Tiny Build Next

Tired of dealing with a front-end mess for tiny websites or prototyping? Tiny Build aims to solve that problem. Tiny Build Next:

- NPM for package management (duh!)
- NPM to run the build scripts
- Browserify to bundle the javascript
- cssnext for transpiling the css
- React for UI components

## Run the scripts

Boot: Installs packages and builds ```npm run boot```

Boot and watch: Installs the packages and then watches for changes ```npm run boot:watch```

Build: Builds the project ```npm run build```

Watch: Watchs the projects ```npm run watch```

## Clean the slate

Wipe: Deletes the build and node_modules dirs ```npm run wipe```

Clean: Deletes just the build dir ```npm run clean```
